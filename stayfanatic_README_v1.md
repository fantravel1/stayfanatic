# STAYFANATIC.COM — README (v1)
**Sleep inside the fandom.**  
**One city. One legendary stay.**

StayFanatic is not a hotel booking site.  
It is not a “best hotels” list.  
It is not about choice abundance.

StayFanatic is a **cultural authority** that answers one question per city:

> **“If you’re a real fan — this is where you stay.”**

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, qualification rules, scoring systems, architecture, page templates, tone, and long-term guardrails** for building StayFanatic into a globally iconic property.

---

## 0) The Core Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

### One city. One legendary stay.

StayFanatic deliberately rejects abundance.

Not:
- Top 10 hotels  
- Best luxury stays  
- Endless comparisons  

Instead:
- **THE stay**
- The one fans whisper about
- The place people say:
  > *“If you know, you know.”*

Scarcity is the brand.
Confidence is the product.

---

## 1) What “Fandom” Actually Means (Critical Expansion)

Fandom is not limited to sports.

StayFanatic covers devotion, identity, and cultural belonging across:

- sports  
- music  
- film  
- television  
- anime  
- gaming  
- fashion  
- motorsport  
- art movements  
- architecture  
- cultural icons  
- entire cities as identity  

If people travel because they *care deeply* — it qualifies.

---

## 2) What StayFanatic Is (and Is Not)

### StayFanatic IS:
- a city-by-city canonical stay authority  
- an editorial-first cultural guide  
- a fandom-to-place translation engine  
- a decision-fatigue killer  
- a high-trust affiliate booking platform  
- a cultural archive of legendary stays  

### StayFanatic is NOT:
- a hotel directory  
- a deal site  
- a luxury flex brand  
- a cosplay novelty site  
- a generic travel blog  
- a listicle factory  

If it feels replaceable, it doesn’t belong.

---

## 3) The Mega-Site Architecture (Clean & Powerful)

### A) City Pages (The Spine)

Every major city gets **one hero stay**.

Example:
```
/cities/london/
```

Each city page includes:
- the single most epic fan stay
- the fandom it represents
- why it matters culturally
- the story behind it
- when it’s worth the splurge
- how to book
- **alternatives only if sold out**

Rule:
If a city needs “top 5,” you haven’t found *the one* yet.

---

### B) Stay Pages (Where the Magic Lives)

Example:
```
/stays/<stay-name>/
```

Each stay page is editorial, not transactional.

---

## 4) The Boldest Rule: Some Stays Aren’t Hotels

A “stay” may be:

- a specific hotel room  
- a boutique hotel  
- a historic inn  
- a ryokan  
- a footballer-owned hotel  
- an artist’s former home  
- a studio-adjacent apartment  
- a capsule hotel with lore  
- a stadium hotel room  
- a castle  
- a monastery  
- a houseboat  
- a brutalist icon  

If it hits the fandom hard, it qualifies.

---

## 5) Fandom Categories (Browsing Engine)

These categories power discovery.

### Canonical Fandom Categories

⚽ **Sports Fanatics**  
🎵 **Music Fanatics**  
🎬 **Film & TV Fanatics**  
🧙 **Geek / Anime / Gaming Fanatics**  
🏁 **Motorsport Fanatics**  
🎨 **Art & Design Fanatics**  
🕍 **History & Culture Fanatics**  

Rule:
A stay must have **one primary fandom**.
Secondary associations are allowed but never equal.

---

## 6) The StayFanatic Test (Non-Negotiable Gate)

A stay only qualifies if **all** of the following are true:

- fans would recognize it instantly  
- it has a story worth retelling  
- staying there changes how you experience the city  
- you’d brag about it once (quietly)  
- it is not easily replicated elsewhere  

If it’s cool but interchangeable, it’s out.

---

## 7) Signature IP: FanaticScore™ (1–100)

Every stay receives a **FanaticScore™**.

This score is not subjective hype.
It is structured authority.

### FanaticScore™ factors

- **Depth of Connection to the Fandom**
- **Authenticity** (real history, not theme décor)
- **Cultural Recognition**
- **Uniqueness**
- **Proximity to Pilgrimage Sites**
- **Storytelling Power**
- **Emotional Impact on Fans**

### Philosophy
- Authenticity beats luxury.
- Lore beats amenities.
- Cultural weight beats star ratings.

---

## 8) Canonical Stay Page Template (Exact Order)

Every stay page must follow this structure.

### Above the Fold (Required)
- Stay name
- City + country
- Primary fandom
- FanaticScore™ (1–100)
- One-line truth statement

Example:
> “Sleep inside football history — steps from where legends were made.”

## 9) “If You Stay Here, Do This” (Experience Loop)

StayFanatic never sells just a room.

Each stay includes:
- rituals
- nearby bars/restaurants
- walking routes
- museums
- stadium tours
- shops

The stay unlocks the city.

---

## 10) The Fan Pilgrimage Map (Next-Level Feature)

Each stay includes a **Pilgrimage Map**:

- related landmarks
- walking distances
- recommended sequence

Cities become stories, not maps.

---

## 11) Editorial Voice (Non-Negotiable)

StayFanatic must sound:

- editorial  
- confident  
- minimalist  
- non-cheesy  
- non-cosplay  

Avoid:
- hype language
- influencer slang
- listicle tone
- hotel marketing copy

Preferred voice:
> “This place matters — and here’s why.”

---

## 12) Design Rules

StayFanatic should feel like:

**Monocle + The Ringer + Kinfolk + Condé Nast Traveler**

Design principles:
- minimal UI
- strong typography
- restrained photography
- story-first layout
- no clutter
- no search overwhelm

---

## 13) Why StayFanatic Can Be a Mega-Site

Because it:
- scales city by city
- creates scarcity
- kills decision fatigue
- attracts high-intent travelers
- monetizes cleanly via affiliate booking
- earns organic backlinks
- lives at the intersection of culture + travel

It can become:

> **The Michelin Guide of fandom stays.**

---

## 14) The Long Game

Eventually StayFanatic expands into:

- annual awards  
- “StayFanatic Certified”  
- limited-edition fan stays  
- partnerships with clubs, studios, artists  
- exclusive access nights  

---

## 15) Example Cities (Proof of Power)

- **London** — football + music  
- **Tokyo** — anime + design  
- **Los Angeles** — film  
- **Paris** — fashion  
- **Milan** — design + motorsport  
- **New York** — everything  
- **Manchester** — music + football  
- **Liverpool** — Beatles  
- **Kyoto** — culture  
- **Berlin** — techno  

One city.
One legendary stay.

---

## 16) The One Rule That Protects Everything

**If the stay can be swapped without heartbreak, it doesn’t belong.**

StayFanatic is about meaning, not options.

That’s the moat.  
That’s the confidence.  
That’s the brand.
